            <article class="story-lp">
                Linkin Park's story begins in 1996 with high school friends Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson forming a band called Xero. After adding Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield, they released a demo but struggled to find a record deal, leading to Wakefield and Farrell's temporary departure. The band found its iconic sound when they recruited singer Chester Bennington in 1999, changed their name to Hybrid Theory, and then Linkin Park before releasing their breakthrough album Hybrid Theory in 2000. The band experienced massive success until the tragic death of Bennington in 2017. Following a hiatus, the band announced a new era with new vocalist Emily Armstrong and the release of their album From Zero in 2024
