                <p>Hybrid Theory is Linkin Park's debut album, released on October 24, 2000 through Warner Bros. Records. Four successful singles were spawned from Hybrid Theory: "One Step Closer", "Crawling", "Papercut", "In The End", but tracks such as "Points Of Authority", "Pushing Me Away", and "My December" were also sent to radio stations for airplay despite not being officially released as singles. The album only peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200, but it would go on to become the best selling debut album of the 21st century.</p></div>

                <div class="album-par"><p>Meteora is American rock band Linkin Park's second studio album, released on March 25, 2003 through Warner Bros. Records. Five official singles were released from Meteora, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Faint", "Numb", "From The Inside", and "Breaking The Habit". "Lying From You" was released as a promotional single in 2004. The official DVD for the album is titled The Making Of Meteora.Meteora is the band's second album. Many view it as a "sequel" to Hybrid Theory, in that the same nu-metal sound is carried on from the previous album. Between the end of the Hybrid Theory touring cycle and the release of Meteora, the band took time to prepare and release their first remix album, Reanimation.</p></div>
